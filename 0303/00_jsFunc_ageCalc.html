  <h1>The Age Calculator</h1>
  <p>
      Write a function named calculateAge that:
  takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
  calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
  outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
  </p>
  <p>
    Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
  </p>

  <script>
      // your code here.
      var calculateAge = function(birth, current){
        var age1 = 0,
            age2 = 0;

        age1 = current - birth;
        age2 - current-1 - birth;

        return "You are either " + age1 + " years or " + age2 + " years old.";
      };
      console.log(calculateAge(1893, 2015));
  </script>
