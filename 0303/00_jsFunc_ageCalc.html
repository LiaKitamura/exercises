    <h1>The Age Calculator</h1>

    <p>
        Write a function named calculateAge that:
    takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
    calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
    outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
    </p>
    <p>
        Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.
    </p>
