    <h1>The Lifetime Supply Calculator</h1>

    Write a function named calculateSupply that:
    <ol>
       <li>
           takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
       </li>
       <li>
           outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
       </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
    </p>
