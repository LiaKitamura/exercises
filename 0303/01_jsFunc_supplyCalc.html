    <h1>The Lifetime Supply Calculator</h1>

    Write a function named calculateSupply that:
    <ol>
       <li>
           takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
       </li>
       <li>
           outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
       </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.
    </p>

    <script>
        // your code here.
        var calculateSupply = function(age, ratePerDay){
          const MAXLIFE = 95;
          var years = 0,
              days = 0,
              leapYears,
              amount = 0;


        years = MAXLIFE - age;
        leapYears = years/4;
        days = years * 365 + leapYears;

        amount = days * ratePerDay;

        return amount;
        };
        console.log("you will need " + calculateSupply(27, 0.5) + " to last you until the ripe old age of 95");
    </script>
